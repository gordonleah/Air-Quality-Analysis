# Air-Quality-Analysis
This  time series data set of the air quality is  measured every hour. Relative humidity is a good indicator of whether the air quality is poor or not. Using linear regression a model is constructed to predict the relative humidity. Any values outside of the normal range 30-60 are considered poor air quality.
